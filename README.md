# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Description
This Python script implements a simple console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game runs for a total of 5 rounds.

## How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. You will be prompted to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. The computer will randomly generate its choice.
4. The winner of each round is determined based on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
   - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.

## Example
```
Round 1
Make your choice: rock
The computer has chosen scissors
You win!

Round 2
Make your choice: paper
The computer has chosen rock
You win!

Round 3
Make your choice: scissors
The computer has chosen paper
You win!

Round 4
Make your choice: rock
The computer has chosen rock
It's a tie!

Round 5
Make your choice: paper
The computer has chosen scissors
You lose...
```

## Notes
- The game runs for 5 rounds, but you can easily modify the script to change the number of rounds or customize the game rules.
- Input is case-insensitive, meaning "Rock," "rock," and "rOcK" are all valid inputs.
- If an invalid choice is entered, the program will prompt you until a valid one is provided.

Enjoy playing Rock, Paper, Scissors!
